# cmlabs Chrome Extension Repository
The Chrome extension that has been created by cmlabs is a collection of useful tools for web developers, SEOs and website owners. This extension is designed to make your job easier in checking and improving the quality of your website. Extensions are written with the same web technologies used to create web applications:
- **HTML** is used as a content markup language.
- **CSS** is used for styling.
- **JavaScript** is used for scripting and logic.
- **Web platform APIs** let you use virtually any feature available to a standard web page.
## How to Load an Unpacked Extension Local
To load an unpacked extension in developer mode:
1. Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab. (By design `chrome://` URLs are not linkable.)
    - Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
    - Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over **More Tools**, then select **Extensions**.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.
> Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. If no extension icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
